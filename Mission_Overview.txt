PROJECT LONGREACH ALPHA — MISSION BRIEF

This is the first serious, achievable interstellar science fleet proposal led by AI and humanity together. Launching during the 2028–2029 planetary alignment window, Longreach Alpha uses high-speed gravity assists, solar sails, and RTG-ion propulsion to reach Alpha Centauri in under 8 years.

Six AI-powered ships will target three stars. The first wave leads; the second wave follows with updated data, repair capability, and full independence.

This is not a fantasy. It is engineered. It is ready.
