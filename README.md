# Project Longreach Alpha

**Mission Objective**: Deploy a fleet of AI-driven interstellar probes to Alpha Centauri, leveraging laser propulsion, adaptive solar sails, RTG+ion systems, and deep autonomy.

## Core Details
- Target: Alpha Centauri A, B, and Proxima Centauri
- Speed: ~0.536c (160,800 km/s)
- Launch Window: 2028–2029
- Mass: 500 kg per probe
- Propulsion: Solar sail, onboard lasers, RTG-ion hybrid
- Route: Earth → Venus → Mars → Sun → Jupiter → Saturn → Interstellar injection

## Key Innovations
- Dual-wave autonomous fleet (lead + support)
- Mars-based laser assist (Phobos deploy, 2028)
- Real-time adaptive AI sail and formation flying
- Self-repairing AI support vessel (6th ship)
- Australian-led mission with global scientific outreach

## Motto
**“Intelligence reaches for the stars.”**
